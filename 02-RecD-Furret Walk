Other pokemon can fly
Majestically through the sky but
I CAN WALK!
(THEY CAN WALK)

Other pokemon can dig
A hole that's real deep and big but
I CAN WALK!
(THEY CAN WALK!)

I don't know quite where I am going, but still
If there's anywhere that can be walked to, I will!

Don't need a reason to keep walking, I just do
Til I'm back home with you!

Other pokemon can shout
And shoot lasers from their mouths but
I CAN WALK!
(THEY CAN WALK)

Other pokemon have quads
One of them is literally god but
I CAN WALK!
(THEY CAN WALK)

And sure, they might be the creator of all
But I'm out here walking while they're trapped in a ball
No destiny or massive pokemon to fight
Just walking 'til the night

Other pokemon evolve
But my growth is long-resolved plus
I CAN WALK!
(THEY CAN WALK!)

Other pokemon lay eggs
I prefer to move my legs cos
I CAN WALK!
(THEY CAN WALK!)

Some say I'm silly and I'm wasting my time
I just keep on walking and I leave them behind
There's no time to be sad when there's so much to see
Further ahead of me
