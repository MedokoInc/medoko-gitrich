# Linus Said 
## Lyrics by Rich Ashford

Linus said that it was open
Linus said that it was GPL
All could use it for whatever they like
And it was okay
Community decided it was good code
People started rolling their own distros
Compiling in C with their Makefiles
'Cause it was good code
Remember back in 1991
He posted on a Minix Usenet group
Just a hobby won't be big at all
Started out with Bash and GCC
On AT discs is where it could be found
people loved it and it got passed around
A multi-threaded filesystem
Running on a 386

Well, Linus said that it was open
Linus said that it was GPL
All could use it for whatever they like
And it was okay
Community decided it was good code
People started rolling their own distros
Compiling in C with their Makefiles
'Cause it was good code

Now a mascot is the thing to do
Little penguin bit him at the zoo
Larry Ewing drew it up for view
Got the name for Tux from James Hughes
Richard Stallman founded GNU
Emacs and GCC too
Licensed under copyleft, it's true
Code is free as in speech for me & you

Well, Linus said that it was open
Linus said that it was GPL
All could use it for whatever they like
And it was okay
Community decided it was good code
People started rolling their own distros
Compiling in C with their Makefiles
'Cause it was good code

I know which shell is mine
My desk is Gnome
When I go surf the interwebs
My browser is Chrome
When my friends ask how it thrives
And how Linus keeps all of it flowin'
Benevolent Dictator For Life
It's why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what Linus said?
You know what he told us?

Well, Linus said that it was open
Linus said that it was GPL
All could use it for whatever they like
And it was okay
Community decided it was good code
People started rolling their own distros
Compiling in C with their Makefiles
'Cause it was good code
